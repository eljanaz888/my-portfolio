# Personal Portfolio Project

This project serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project, giving you full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

This project is my personal portfolio and showcases my skills and projects. It can be deployed using various platforms and methods. Below are a few options:

- **GitHub Pages:** Configure your repository's settings to deploy the `build` folder to GitHub Pages. Update the `"homepage"` field in `package.json` with the correct URL.

- **Netlify:** Connect your Netlify account to your repository. Configure the build settings with the build command (`npm run build`) and build folder (`build`).

- **Vercel:** Link your project repository to Vercel. It will automatically detect the build command and deploy your app.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
